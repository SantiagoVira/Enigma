# Enigma
An enigma machine I coded in python. Feel free to take a look!

# Setup
To run the Enigma machine on your computer, you can either:
 - Dowload the .exe file which is essentially an app and run it
 - Download the main.py file and run it in your python interpreter

# Instructions

**Setting Up The Plugborad**

To access the plugboard, click on the bottom of the screen, right under all of the letters. This will bring up a white screen with 26 ports and their corresponding letters. To connect two letters together in the Enigma logic, simply left click on the letters you would like to connect. To remove plugs, right click on the number you want to remove, and left click on a different port to place it somewhere else.

**Setting Up The Rotors**

You can click the bottom of the screen to switch back to the main view. Above all of the letters, you will see 3 rectangles each with 3 letters. These are the rotors, and changing their positions before the Encryption is another step to prevent the message from being decrypted. To turn them, click on the top section of the rectangle to turn the rotor p, and the bottom section to rotate it down. Be sure to remember the starting position so other people can decrypt your message.

**Encryption Time**

To encrypt a message, first make sure you are on the main screen and are not viewing the plugboard. Then, be sure to remember the positions (or the middle letters) of each rotor and which letters on the plugboard are connected. Once you have all of that information, simply start typing your message and watch which letters on the screen begin to glow. These are the encrypted letters that your message translates to. Write down all of the letters in your message, and share it with whoever you choose, along with the starting orientation of everything so that they may actually decrypt it.

# Enjoy!
